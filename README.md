an easy puzzle about 40 students and 4 train classes. each student can intend 1 to 4 classes. now , each two students have the same class. question : for the most class, when and what is its least value?

for example: 4 students and 3 classes. 
          class a  class b  class c
student a   yes      yes       no
student b   yes       no      yes
student b   no       yes      yes
student b   yes      yes      yes

in this condition ,the most group contains 3 students, and obviously the value is the least , it cant be 2.

so, what if there are 40 student an 4 classes?
